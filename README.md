# time-series-dash
Just an acorn of a time-series visualization project with Python using Dash; under heavy development.

On the surface, gui has far to go to look passable, and code underneath will probably undergo many changes as Dash (the underlying library) matures. 

More statistical routines are planned to be added. Currently only SARIMA available.

Instructions to run: set up a redis server with 'redis-server' in terminal, and fire off app.py.

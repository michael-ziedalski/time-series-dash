# time-series-dash
Just an acorn of a time-series visualization project, using Python with Dash; under heavy development.

Gui under constant revision, and internal will likely change over time as Dash matures.

Currently only statistical routine implemented is SARIMA.

To run, simply set up a redis server with 'redis-server' in terminal and fire off app.py, or host via herokue by cloning this repo and following these instructions: https://dash.plot.ly/deployment

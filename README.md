# time-series-dash
Just an acorn of a time-series visualization project, using Python with Dash; under heavy development.

Gui under constant revision and more statistical features to be added in the future. Currently only SARIMA available.

To run, simply set up a redis server with 'redis-server' in terminal and fire off app.py, or host via heroku by cloning this into your repo and following these instructions: https://dash.plot.ly/deployment

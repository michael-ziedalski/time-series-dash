Updated list of what needs to be done, in order of relative importance.

Features:
  1. Finish the forecasting feature.
  2. Add GARCH model
  3. Add button to keep analyzing data (i.e. running models) as user messes around with the dates.
  4. Find a way to keep track of all successfully run models in memory, and reuse them if same inputs are given.

CSS/HTML:
  1. Find way to make current app loading indicator take longer to trigger; currently screen greys for a moment for every little event,
  and no custom loading events/animations per component.
  
Bugs:
  1. On small datasets (>~30), the data doesn't start at the graph's axes, causing the rangeslider to not line up,
  (should be a fix in specifying the graph's axes).
